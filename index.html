        journey into the world of <b>technology</b> and <b>coding</b>.She has always been curious about how websites and applications worked, 
        but never imagined she would start learning how to build them herself.</p>

    headings,paragraphs and even formatting her text using <b>bold</b>,<i>italic</i> and <u>underline</u> elements.</p>

            her patience. <b>But she never gave up</b>. She knew that with every mistake, she was one step closer to becoming 
            a confident coder.
            At the end of this program, Patience can build simple web pages and will slowly venture into <i>JavaScript</i> to make 
            her project interactive.</p>

            <h3>The Road Adead</h3>

                started sharing her progress on social media to inspire others, especially other women, to dive
                into the world of coding.
